  - Positioned above video controls for easy access
  - Automatically shows/hides based on current playback position
  - Only works in normal viewing mode (limitation: not visible in fullscreen due to HTML5 video fullscreen constraints)
  - Synced across all party members when clicked
  - **Note:** Requires Emby API key to be configured for intro marker detection

- **Intelligent PGS Subtitle Handling**: Smart detection and burn-in for image-based subtitles
  - Automatically detects PGS (Presentation Graphic Stream) subtitles
  - Burns in PGS/VobSub/DVD subtitles for pixel-perfect quality
  - Supports: pgssub, pgs, dvd_subtitle, dvdsub, vobsub formats
  - Prevents quality loss from PGS-to-text conversion
  - Works on both GPU and software encoding setups
  - PGS subtitles marked with [Burned-in] indicator in dropdown

- **Independent VTT Subtitle Selection**: Per-user subtitle language choice

  - Each party member can independently choose their subtitle language
  - Uses native browser CC button for subtitle selection
  - No transcode restarts needed for VTT subtitle changes
  - Subtitle dropdown automatically hides when only VTT subtitles available
  - PGS subtitles remain synced (burned-in), VTT selection is local-only

### Changed
- **Subtitle Workflow**: Dual-mode subtitle handling
  - PGS subtitles: Server-side burn-in with `SubtitleMethod=Encode` (synced for all users)
  - Text subtitles: Client-side VTT loading with independent selection (local per user)
  - Subtitle dropdown now only shows PGS options when available
  - Audio selection remains synced across all party members (requires transcode)

- **Multi-Audio Track Support**: Re-enabled audio track selection
  - Added back `AudioStreamIndex` parameter for proper audio track selection
  - Users can now switch between multiple audio tracks (e.g., different languages)
  - Audio track changes are synced across all party members

  - Client compensates for network and loading delays
  - Sync accuracy improved from ¬±4 seconds to sub-second precision
  - Simpler, more reliable sync mechanism

### Fixed
- **Mid-Play Join Sync Issues**: Complete overhaul of new joiner sync behavior
  - Fixed video restarting to 0:00 for existing users when someone joins
  - New joiners now start at correct position (e.g., 22 minutes, not 0:00)
  - New joiners can immediately receive play/pause/seek commands
  - Set isSyncing flag before loadVideo() to prevent MANIFEST_PARSED reset
  - Use HLS.js startPosition config to load correct video segments immediately
  - Clear isSyncing in MANIFEST_PARSED to allow command processing
  - Server calculates elapsed time since last play/pause/seek for accurate sync
  - Client compensates for network + metadata loading delay (0.1-0.5s typical)
  - Loading delay compensation capped at 2 seconds to prevent over-compensation

- **False Drift Detection**: Eliminated random seeking and desyncing
  - Periodic sync was detecting false "drift" after pause/play
  - Example: Pause at 496s, play again ‚Üí periodic sync thought 5s drift existed
  - Removed periodic sync - play/pause/seek events provide sufficient sync
  - No more random video forwarding or seeking
  - Pause/play now works smoothly without desyncing users

- **Subtitle Filtering and Sync Issues**: Resolved subtitle-related sync loop bug
  - Fixed issue where mid-play joiners caused sync loops
  - Improved subtitle stream filtering logic
  - Better handling of default/forced subtitle selection
  - Removed invalid `SubtitleMethod=Drop` parameter (doesn't exist in Emby API)
  - Fixed PGS subtitles appearing by default when "None" selected

  - Changed subtitle container visibility from `display` to `visibility` toggle
  - Prevents Audio and Stop Video button from squishing together
  - Added max-width to stream controls for consistent spacing

### Technical
- **Server-Side (app.py):**
  - Calculate accurate current time when new user joins (handle_join_party)
  - Add elapsed time since last_update to playback_state.time for playing videos
  - Send compensated time to new joiners: `current_time = stored_time + elapsed`
  - Added debug logging for new joiner sync calculations

- **Client-Side (party.js):**
  - Capture sync_state arrival time for delay compensation
  - Set playbackStartTime when new joiner starts playing
  - Disabled periodic sync (removed from play handler and sync_state handler)
  - Improved periodic sync guards (check both party state and video state)
  - Enhanced subtitle stream detection with `isPGS` flag
  - Automatic text track cleanup in `loadAllTextSubtitles()` function
  - Modified subtitle dropdown event listener to only emit party sync for PGS subtitles

- **Code Cleanup:**

  - Removed 12 development console.log statements
  - Reduced party.js from 1493 to 1459 lines (34 lines saved)

  - Much easier to communicate over phone or in person
- **Tighter Sync Threshold**: Reduced from 0.5s to 0.3s for better accuracy
  - Fixed misleading comment (was "2 seconds" but code was 0.5s)
  - More accurate synchronization between players
